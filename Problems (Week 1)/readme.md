#### Description
  Doe is a first-year student of Informatics, ITS. One day, he applied for an internship position at FUND Corp. as a Software Engineer there. During the selection process, his coding skills were tested. Unfortunately, he had difficulties solving a problem and was given a chance to contact a friend to help him. Doe decided to ask for your help. Write a program so that Doe can be accepted!
  
  The program will receive a single integer, n, as an input. Then based on n's value, it will output: 'Fizz' if n is divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if n is divisible by 5, both as 'FizzBuzz' if n is divisible by 3 and 5, or simply print out n if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5.
#### Input Format
  A single integer (n) as described in the problem description.
#### Output Format
  Print either:
  * 'Fizz' if n is divisible by 3,
  * 'Buzz' if n is divisible by 5,
  * 'FizzBuzz' if n is divisible by 3 and 5,
  * else n if neither.

## Ganesis and Pillars
#### Descriptions
  "Why are we still here? just to suffer?", said a man once. This is a tale of "B", just a boy. He is a trainee of martial arts in his little town "MSF". He is hoping to one day roam the world and more. A part of his training is to jump between pillars in MSF. There are exactly 5 pillars, namely A, Bee, C, D, and E. They are ordered from left to right with A as the first pillar, and E as the last pillar. The pillars are identical in height, but the distance between one pillar to the next pillar may vary. He must jump from the first pillar to the last pillar one pillar at a time. B has a maximum jump distance of n. He can jump from one pillar to the next if the distance is not greater than B's maximum jump distance. Help B to determine whether he can clear this challenge or not. If he can print "YES HE CAN" without the quotation marks. If he fails, print "NO HE CAN'T" without the quotation marks.
  
#### Input Format
  A single line containing n , the distance of A to Bee, Bee to C, C to D, and D to E.

#### Output Format
  If he can print "YES HE CAN" without the quotation marks. If he fails, print "NO HE CAN'T" without the quotation marks.
 
#### Example
* Input 0
  <pre>
    1 1 1 1 1

## Problem 4
## Dedibay and His Rules
#### Descriptions

A long time ago, lived an old man called “Dedibay”. He lived alone in the middle of savanna with no lover, children, neighbors, even human around him. He sleeps alone, breakfast, lunch, dinner alone, He did his daily activity alone. He did that because he wanted to get an immortal live. When he was young, he went to Dukun. The Dukun gave the rules that Dedibay needs to do to live immortal. There are only two rules. First, Dedibay can’t live together with any person, relatives, even with no neighbor. Second, Dedibay should eat equal amount of every food stuff.

The first rules had been fulfilled. But now, Dedibay is having a problem with the second rules. Dedibay lives immortal, but his physics also his brain is getting older. The more Dedibay getting older, the more his brain getting slower. Because of that, help Dedibay to count his food stuff to get the equal amount so he can continue his immortal live. If the food stuff is equal, print "YES! DADDY CAN LIVE IMMORTAL" without the quotation marks. If the food stuff is not equal, print "NO! GOODBYE DADDY, RIP" without the quotation marks.

#### Input Format
  A single integer (n) as foodstuff that you want to compare.
  
#### Output Format 
  If the food stuff is equal, print "YES! DADDY CAN LIVE IMMORTAL" without the quotation marks. If the food stuff is not equal, print "NO! GOODBYE DADDY, RIP" without the quotation marks.
  
#### Example
  * Input 0
    <pre>
